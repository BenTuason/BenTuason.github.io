# About

Hello! My name is Ben Tuason, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Houston, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in theoretical computer science, including algorithms, complexity theory, quantum computing, cryptography, circuit complexity, boolean function analysis, and learning theory. My hobbies include scribing notes from lectures I enjoy watching, coding simulation projects, and playing video games like League of Legends. I am also a part of UHâ€™s ICPC competitive programming team and CTF team.

## Future Plans

I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in theoretical computer science, focusing on topics in algorithms and complexity theory. My goal is to contribute to the field through innovative research and collaboration.
